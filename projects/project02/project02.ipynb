    "\n",
    "The flights dataset for 2015 is not small (~600MB). While you could likely load the entire dataset into Pandas on your laptop, if you wanted to work with more than one year, this would quickly become difficult (the data is available for 1987-2018). Therefore, we will filter down the dataset into two smaller files without ever reading the larger dataset fully into memory. We are going to create two smaller datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All flights arriving or departing from San Diego International Airport in 2015.\n",
    "    - You can find a list of all the airport codes in the United States [here](https://www.leonardsguide.com/us-airport-codes.shtml).\n",
    "2. All flights flown by either JetBlue or Southwest Airline in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you are going to use the `chunksize=N` keyword in Pandas `read_csv` to read the flights dataset in blocks of `N` lines. When you use this keyword argument, `pd.read_csv(fp, chunksize=N)` becomes a *iterator* that iterates through dataframes of length N until you have reached the end of the dataset. A typical pattern looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "L = pd.read_csv(filepath, chunksize=1000)\n",
    "for df in L:\n",
    "    process(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where each `df` is a dataframe of length 1000. \n",
    "\n",
    "The processing you are going to do is:\n",
    "1. Iterate through the dataset, chunk-by-chunk,\n",
    "2. Filtering out rows of each chunk\n",
    "3. Incrementally add to a filtered csv file (since the data is perhaps too big to keep in memory). Keep in mind, if you want to keep writing to the same file, the mode='a' keyword in the `.to_csv` method can be helpful when calling it in the loop (a stands for 'append')\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Write two functions that create the datasets below, using the 'chunking' pattern described above. Your functions should use `chunksize` of 10000.\n",
    "1. `get_san` which takes in a filepath containing all flights and a filepath where filtered dataset #1 is written. The function should return `None`.\n",
    "1. `get_jb_sw` which takes in a filepath containing all flights and a filepath where filtered dataset #2 is written. The function should return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 1*: **Gradescope autograding servers are quite small and can't load this dataset into memory** -- so your code that reads in the large `flights.csv` dataset *must* work with chunks of the dataset one at a time to pass!\n",

    "* Second, decide the best data *type* for each column. Create a function `data_types` of zero variables which outputs a (hard-coded) dictionary of data types, keyed by column name, with values `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 1*: A column which *should* be `int`s, but contains `NaN`, *must* be a float column. See Lecture 2 notes an explanation of `NaN` and data-types.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 2*: As with real data, some data processing decisions may be ambiguous here. Make the best decision using the information available to you. It may be helpful to (re)read the relevant [section of the textbook](https://afraenkel.github.io/practical-data-science/03/kinds-of-data.html). \n",

    "Often `DEPARTURE_DELAY` is thought to be the main cause of a flight delay -- i.e., when the flight is late pushing off from the gate. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are other ways that flights can be late: waiting on the tarmac, headwinds, turbulence, circling a busy airport, and waiting for a gate after landing. First, we will analyze all the ways in which a flight can be delayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, create a function `depart_arrive_stats` that takes in a dataframe like `flights` and calculates the following quantities in a series, indexed by `late1`, `late2`, `late3`:\n",
    "    - `late1`: the proportion of flights from/to SAN that leave late, but arrive early or on-time.\n",
    "    - `late2`: the proportion of flights from/to SAN that leave early, or on-time, but arrive late.\n",
    "    - `late3`: the proportion of flights from/to SAN that both left late and arrived late.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Second, create a function `depart_arrive_stats_by_month` that takes in a dataframe like `flights` and calculates the quantities above broken down by *month*. That is, the output is a dataframe, indexed by `MONTH`, with columns given by `late1`, `late2`, `late3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 1:* Does this question reveal any data quality issues? Can you pinpoint when these issues occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 2:* A flight is considered late if it departed/arrived any time later than its planned departure/arrival time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 3:* You do not need to manually calculate the delay time for those delays that are `NaN`."
