While you could likely load the entire dataset into Pandas on your laptop, if you wanted to work with more than one year, this would quickly become difficult (the data is available for 1987-2018). Therefore, we will filter down the dataset into two smaller files without ever reading the larger dataset fully into memory. We are going to create two smaller datasets:\n",

When you use this keyword argument, `pd.read_csv(fp, chunksize=N)` becomes a *iterator* that iterates through dataframes of length N until you have reached the end of the dataset. A typical pattern looks like:\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Write two functions that create the datasets below, using the 'chunking' pattern described above. Your functions should use `chunksize` of 10000.\n",
