    "**Do not change the function names in the `*.py` file**\n",

    "- You are **encouraged to write your own additional functions** to solve the questions! \n",

    "* Run your functions on very small datasets (e.g. 1-5 row table), calculate the expected response by hand, and see if the function output matches (this *is* unit-testing your code with data).\n",

Suggestions on checking your work are given in the assignment, but you should also think of your own ways of checking your work.\n",
